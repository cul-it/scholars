<p>
Thank you for your interest in updating your information presented in VIVO. 
</p>
Faculty who submit information through Activity Insight annual reporting 
may not edit their profile information directly in VIVO to prevent over-writing 
of information imported from Activity Insight.  This was done as a result of 
preferences expressed by faculty campus wide for a "single point of entry."
</p>
<p>
VIVO profiles are updated incrementally from Activity Insight on a weekly 
basis based on your choice of "yes"" on the public flag question on each record.  
If you want data in a particular record to be updated into VIVO, please enter it 
via Activity Insight and mark the public flag "yes." 
</p>
<p>
You may contact the VIVO team for an urgent change to your profile via the 
<a href="contact">Contact Form</a>.  If you have questions regarding Activity 
Insight, please contact your college's Activity Insight administrator.
