  <div class="panel-heading facet-panel-heading faq-heading">What is Scholars@Cornell?</div>
  <div class="panel-body faq-answer">
    <ul class="lower-alpha-list">
		<li>
		As stewards of the scholarly record, Cornell University Library (CUL) has developed a data and visualization service known as Scholars@Cornell with the goal of improving the visibility of Cornell research and enabling discovery of explicit and latent patterns of scholarly collaboration. The primary entity of interest is scholarship, of which people and organizations are, by definition, both the creators and consumers. 
        </li>
		<li>
		Scholars@Cornell provides visualizations-driven aggregate views of the scholarship data where dynamic visualizations become the entry points into a rich graph of knowledge that can be explored interactively to answer questions such as: Who are the experts in what areas? Which departments collaborate with each other? What are patterns of interdisciplinary research? What are the impact evidences of my research? With which global organizations we collaborate with, and more. Our goal is to enable easy discovery of both explicit and latent patterns that reveal high-impact research areas, patterns of collaboration, and expertise of faculty and researchers.

  <div class="panel-heading facet-panel-heading faq-heading">Where does Scholars@Cornell get data?</div>
  <div class="panel-body faq-answer">
  <ul class="lower-alpha-list">
		<li>
		Scholars@Cornell is fed automatically with a variety of data sources, such as Cornell's own Human Resources (HR) data, publication data from <a href="http://symplectic.co.uk/products/elements/" title="Symplectic Elements">Symplectic Elements</a>, and grants data from <a href="https://www.osp.cornell.edu/" title="Office of Sponsored Programs">Office of Sponsored Programs</a> (OSP).
      </li>
	<li>
		Once data has entered Scholars@Cornell's workflow, the "feed machine" engages in automated data curation, which entails cleansing data anomalies and suppressing duplicates.  A special process known as "uberization" evaluates the publication data coming from Elements (i.e. multiple sources) to select the best, most accurate data elements to be included in Scholars@Cornell.  If the "feed machine" determines that the data is not of sufficient quality and cannot be automatically corrected, it sends the data to a "curation bin" where it can be examined and corrected or rejected as necessary by a local data curator.

  <div class="panel-heading facet-panel-heading faq-heading">What is Symplectic Elements?</div>
  <div class="panel-body faq-answer">
  <ul class="lower-alpha-list">
		<li>
			<a href="http://symplectic.co.uk/products/elements/" title="Symplectic Elements">Symplectic Elements</a> is an application for research information management (RIM).  It is intended for academic units to manage faculty information such as scholarly articles, grants, teaching activities and other professional pursuits. Elements provides an easy to use interface to maintain accurate and up to date scholarship data for Cornell faculty.
  		</li>
		<li>
			Elements harvests Cornell faculty member scholarship data from well known citation services (e.g. <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com/" title="Web of Science">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com" title="Scopus">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" title="PubMed">PubMed</a>, <a href="https://www.mla.org/" title="MLA">MLA</a>), data is claimed by a college/department data curator, in turn that data is fed to Scholars@Cornell, where researcher profile pages are created and exciting visualizations of data are presented.
  		</li>
		<li>
			Enabling <a href="https://orcid.org/" title="ORCID">ORCID</a>, and other author ID's for individual profiles provides the benefit of reducing manual data curation through an auto-claim feature in Elements.
  		</li>
		<li>
			Cornell University Library subscribes to <a href="http://symplectic.co.uk/products/elements/" title="Symplectic Elements">Symplectic Elements</a> and administers the Cornell instance of Elements.
