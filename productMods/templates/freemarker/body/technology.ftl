 <p class="about-para-narrow">A key component of the Scholars system is the Scholars-Viz component that bridges semantically rich data in a VIVO knowledge graph with the Scholars-Web application that provides the user interface for searching for experts and browsing the scholarly record with dynamic D3 visualizations.  Behind the scenes, the Scholars-Feedmachine provides automated data feeds and performs automated data curation tasks, ultimately transforming data into RDF so that it can be loaded into the VIVO knowledge graph.   Scholars is integrated with Sympletic Elements which is an application used by Cornell academic departments to manage faculty information and to obtain automated citation feeds from well known sources such as Web of Science, PubMed, SCOPUS, MLA and others.</p>
