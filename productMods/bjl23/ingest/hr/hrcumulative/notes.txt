HR CUMULATIVE PROCESS NOTES

Additional automation notes:
Ideally, a human should only have to 



1. Two named graphs: "tank" (temporary workspace) and "store" (cumulative data store)
	Named graph URIs:
	tank:	http://vivo.cornell.edu/ns/hrcumulative/graph/tank/
	store:	http://vivo.cornell.edu/ns/hrcumulative/graph/store/

	Store grows only monotonically.
	Actually, do we want this?  If we use a "latest" marker, then we will have retractions.
	Let's try it without a "latest" marker first and see how it goes.  People's things 
	shouldn't be changing so frequently that it's a problem to iterate through the versions.
	If it is, we'll have to switch to something different.

2.  Tank operations for new HR ingest:
	A. Each spreadsheet is read into tank using CSV converter.
		Namespace in which to generate resources:
			http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/ns/hr/hrcumulative/YYYY-MM-DD/
		Namespace in which to generate class and properties:
			http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/ns/bjl23/hr/1#
		Destination model:
			tank
		Destination model for TBox:
			none

	B. SPARQL CONSTRUCT is run to tag each resource with a timestamp.

	C. SPARQL CONSTRUCT is run to create object properties between resources.

3. Merging tank into store.

	D. for each person (rules1:Person) in tank:
			Get Emplid.
			If an Individual resource with Emplid exists in store, get latest version of each related object 
				(including person) : if different, add latest version into store.
			If an individual with the emplid does not exist, copy EVERYTHING into the store.
	
	Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of great ways of handling this declaratively in the currently-available
	formalisms.
	

----- THE HR WORKFLOW AFTER UPDATING THE CUMULATIVE STORE

1.) Make CornellemailnetId - append "@cornell.edu"
2.) Make new orgs
3.) Link new orgs to unit
4.) Run appointment property CONSTRUCTS
5.) general HR properties
6.) Moniker and label
7.) TYPES - need a formalism for this
8.) Portal and College flags - try again with Pellet?  Need to extract a current Vitro TBOX minus domain and range axioms
9.)
