HR CUMULATIVE PROCESS NOTES

1. Two named graphs: "tank" (temporary workspace) and "store" (cumulative data store)
	Named graph URIs:
	tank:	http://vivo.cornell.edu/ns/hrcumulative/graph/tank/
	store:	http://vivo.cornell.edu/ns/hrcumulative/graph/store/

	Store grows only monotonically.

2.  Tank operations for new HR ingest:
	A. Each spreadsheet is read into tank using CSV converter.
		Namespace in which to generate resources:
			http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/ns/hr/hrcumulative/YYYY-MM-DD/
		Namespace in which to generate class and properties:
			http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/ns/bjl23/hr/1#
		Destination model:
			tank
		Destination model for TBox:
			none

	B. SPARQL CONSTRUCT is run to tag each resource with a timestamp.

	C. SPARQL CONSTRUCT is run to create object properties between resources.

	D. for each person in tank:
			Get Emplid.
			If a resource with Emplid exists in store, get latest version of each related object 
				(including person)
			If person is different, copy all new objects into store.
	`		If version in tank is different, copy that object to the store.  Remove "latest" marker from old store object.  Add to new store object.
