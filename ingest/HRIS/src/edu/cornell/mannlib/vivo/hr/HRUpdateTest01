/** HRIS Ingest Test v10
* methods to create RDF for HRIS adds and changes
* cmw48  Oct 2011
*  TODO:
*  
*   build netId match to find HRIS that should already be in VIVO
*   lots of work in ConstructHRISRDFData
*   implement log4j
*    
*    Learn how to pass Jena models between methods, or make them available to multiple methods
*      current workaround is to query from services and writing RDF to files
*      read files into model whenever they are needed
*      - allows re-use of RDF files for different tasks
*      - provides a baseline history for the state of add/retract based on emplId iso at time of ingest
